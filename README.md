# AI-Powered Notes App

**AI-Powered Notes App** is a simple and intuitive application that leverages generative AI to assist users in creating and managing their notes. Not only does the app use AI to suggest note content, but the application code itself was generated with the help of generative AI. This showcases the potential of AI in streamlining software development.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Notes**: Generate ideas or note suggestions using generative AI.  
- **Code by AI**: The application was coded by leveraging generative AI for its logic and structure.  
- **Note Management**: Add, edit, and delete notes effortlessly.  
- **UserDefaults Integration**: Data persistence using `UserDefaults` for lightweight and efficient storage.  
- **SwiftUI Interface**: A clean and modern UI built with SwiftUI.  
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Programming language used to develop the app.  
- **SwiftUI**: For building the application's user interface.  
- **MVVM Pattern**: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for better code organization.  
- **UserDefaults**: Database solution for lightweight data storage.  
- **Generative AI**: Used for both creating note suggestions and writing the application code.

## How It Works

1. **AI-Generated Code**:  
   The application's core structure and logic were generated by generative AI.  

2. **AI Note Suggestions**:  
   Provides users with AI-generated note ideas.  

3. **Data Storage**:  
   Notes are stored in `UserDefaults`, ensuring persistent data across sessions.  

4. **MVVM Structure**:  
   - **Model**: Represents the note structure.  
   - **ViewModel**: Handles business logic, including AI integration and note management.  
   - **View**: Displays the list of notes and provides a user-friendly interface for interactions.  

5. **SwiftUI Design**:  
   Dynamic and responsive interface that adapts to user input seamlessly.
